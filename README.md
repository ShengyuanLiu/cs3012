# Annotation
About this project work , i divide it into two parts and one of it is the LCA 
for the binary tree and another one is the LCA of the DAG graph

So in the beginning of the work i choose the different algorithm for these 
two problems and create two clients in the github to avoid the unnecessary 
conflict and merge the DAG branch into the master branch in the end

The project 1 is using to build the method of the LCA of binary tree and test it.
And the project 2 is using to bulid the method of the LCA of DAG and test it.
Just in case, i also add the binary test into the DAG test file to show that the DAG 
method applies equally to the binary tree test.

And the test are also different with each other.
